This is just one of countless examples of this, which is also why Momota almost never cross court smashes from the around-the-head situation (as it is even harder to run to an around-the-head reply, due to footwork only allowing 2 steps to the lunging foot, rather than 3 (for the forehand side))).', '·', '‘Long net’', 'tldr; Stops opponent from playing tight net shots', 'i.e. playing [net/drop] shots away from the net', 'As alluded to above, this prevents the opponent from playing a tight net shot, which could potentially force a short lift or end the rally, as shots with more forward momentum, that are further from the net are more difficult to play tight net shots off of.', 'Commonly employed by the Danish players, were they push net shots into the court (I think this was also mentioned by one of the English-speaking Danish commentators in a match this year, but I am not sure which one), and in more extreme cases, where they play very few drop shots / net shots (more so in someone like Axelsen).', 'This can be seen by watching most of Kento Momota’s games (e.g. the 2019 world championship final), where he plays straight flat drop shots from the forehand side (possibly his most used shot), which are played flat to purposefully have enough forward momentum to force a weak net reply, whilst also being short enough to force the opponent to move forwards.

Most people have a much weaker forehand defense than backhand. Note that some doubles players defend even their forehand side with their backhand. The reason is that your wrist can better swing back on the backhand side. Adding to this, most players also actually have a stronger smash from their backhand corner when they manage to get under the ball so smashing straight from your backhand side to the opponents forehand is typically the better strategy (when you can get under the ball).

However, I based my theory on personal experience, watching matches (seeing how high above the net the the smash defence was), commentator comments (e.g. “chen long’s forehand defence is much better that his backhand side” (paraphrasing)), and also from deducing the reasons behind other strategies, like the mentioned preferred lift side. To expand on my last point, I first noticed that Momota lifted/cleared to the opponents forehand all the time- so I naturally thought ‘that must be because the overhead smash is more powerful’. However, I later realised that most right hand vs. right hand matches have many lifts to the backhand side, which lead me to believe that it was the backhand defence, given my observation of the higher prevalence of straight shots (as this was what these two scenarios had in common).', 'But like you say, there are other factors, such as power, precision and tailoring play to the opponents weakness that may come into play as well, and many doubles players clearly have no issue defending with their backhand.

Momota plays a lot to the forehand to make sure that the opponents do not stand too deep into the backhand corner. Axelsen in particular is lethal from the backhand corner around the head but can have trouble moving into the forehand corner in time to generate equal power from the forehand (partly because of his height/size). Momota plays a lot of the typical small guy vs. big guy tactics against him (play forehand corner and before the feet to make the big guy move and bend).',), ('This being said... you should of course play low lifts to rhe backhand side - especially against weaker players but it is also a common tactic at higher levels...',), ('I have not seen many resources online which truly breakdown the reasons behind tactics', 'I believe this is because at the top levels of play, tactics change very quickly.
